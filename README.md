# Hotels in the USA

This project uses an Parse App created at [Back4app](https://www.back4app.com), which has a free, public database connected from the [Database Hub](https://www.back4app.com/database) containing the [Hotels in the USA](https://www.back4app.com/database/hotels-data/database-all-hotels-usa) to make a few queries and demonstrate data usage.

Use this App as you'd like. It is free to use and distribute.

If your system already has[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed, just run this command:

   $ npm install parse

All the documentation about the Javascript SDK canb e found in the [Javascript Docs](https://www.back4app.com/docs/javascript/parse-javascript-sdk).
